SRTM to PNG Utility Read Me
===

### Sample Files

Many thanks to the The Satellite Geodesy research group at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego 
for preparing and maintaining this data.

Click on any of the 33 links in the web page below to view the sample PNG files:

* All 33 Scripps Institute files translated into PNG files
* First 12 files are in the beautiful (but as yet unusable BGR) format. Remaining files are standard RGB heightmaps
* Credits and attributions are available at: <http://caper.ws/terrain-srtm30-plus/>

* R2 is current

## Concept

### Mission

Provide a fast simple utility that translates SRTM or HGT binary data files into PNG files 

### Vision

Make it fast and easy to access 3D elevation data over the Web

## Features

* Built with Node.js  
* Reads a directory of SRTM files, translates them to PNGs and writes them to disk  
* Only 62 lines of code
* Translates a 56 MB file to ~30 MB PNG in under 10 seconds


## Road Map

* Set red as the default color rather than blue
