SRTM30 Plus Viewer Read Me

### Viewer

[SRTM30 Plus Viewer (latest)]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-srtm30-plus/srtm-viewer/latest/ )

The viewer reads SRTM30 Plus data made available by:

The Satellite Geodesy research group at [Scripps Institution of Oceanography]( https://scripps.ucsd.edu/ ), University of California San Diego

## Concept

### Mission

Provide a web browser viewer SRTM30 Plus files - binary data containers of elevation data. 
Translates data on the fly and displays in your browser

### Vision

Help make it easier and faster to visualize mashed-up elevation data from a variety of sources


## Features

* Reads the binary data from SRTM30 Plus files and displays it as a colored image
* Converts 'big endian' data to 'little endian' data
* Displays SRTM files in <http://caper.ws/terrain-srtm30-plus/srtm/> - which is CORS-enabled
	* 30 Second data from Scripps Institute/UCSD
* Elevation, X & Y, RGB, minimum and maximum elevations and other data are displayed as you move your cursor over the image
	* Verifies that data goes from file to image to data correctly
* Select to view in 'raw' or 'pretty' or 'mistake' colors
	* Pretty colors are generated by algorithm
	* The algorithm sets a color range algorithm that can cope with plus or minus 11K elevations
	* Mistake colors are simply BGR instead of RGB - but are much more readable by the human eye
* Checks the file for exceptions - data lower than the Marianas Trench or higher than Mount Everest
* Provides ability to save the data as a PNG bitmap


## Road Map

* Change from txt list to CSF and add names of locations to each fole
* Permalinks
* Provide a color look up table until a nice color algorithm is worked out
* Have all the features of [PNG Viewer]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-viewer/png-viewer/readme-reader.html )
* Capability to differentiate distinctly color ranges above and below zero

## Issues /Bugs

* Exceptions are not properly recorded
* Elevation colors in 'pretty' mode are not pretty enough
