SRTM to TMS7 Dev Notes

2014-04-30 ~ Theo

11:?? Create folders and files

12:00 first runs, creating new PNGs
made the 33 pngs in 291 seconds on thheop
7:59 ~ The rest of the day ended up being a series of silly events.
I did stuff that created infinite loops so bad they froze my computer. SO I thought I was having HW issues.
Got over that after a few hours. Then I got into a trap of thinking the SRTM file was a PNG file - with four bytes per point etc.
Made pretty quarter size maps. Which totally confused things - since it looked like it was working but broken 
Actually it was broken but looked like it was working.
