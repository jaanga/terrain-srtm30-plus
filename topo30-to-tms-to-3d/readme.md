## Concept

### Mission  
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->
* Fully interactive 3D viewers for data files created by the [Satellite Geodesy research group at Scripps 
Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego]( http://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm30_plus.html )
* Based on the unFlatland series of scripts that make creating 3D views easier

### Vision

## Project Links

Jaanga is a [GitHub]( http://github.com) [organization account]( https://help.github.com/articles/what-s-the-difference-between-user-and-organization-accounts ) and has multiple owners and admins. 
All Jaanga scripts are [FOSS]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software ).


## System Requirements

In order to run the script you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/)
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the script on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The script is currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
